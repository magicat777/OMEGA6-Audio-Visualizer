# OMEGA5 vs OMEGA6 Comparison

## Architecture Comparison

### OMEGA5 (Custom OpenGL)
- **Engine**: Custom OpenGL/ModernGL implementation
- **Audio**: Custom FFT processing
- **UI**: ImGui overlay on OpenGL
- **Performance**: 30-45 FPS with issues
- **Complexity**: Very high
- **Maintenance**: Difficult

### OMEGA6 (Friture-Based)
- **Engine**: Friture's proven audio engine
- **Audio**: Optimized FFT from Friture
- **UI**: Qt5 native widgets
- **Performance**: Target 60 FPS stable
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Maintenance**: Plugin-focused

## Key Improvements

### 1. Stability
- **OMEGA5**: Frequent crashes, memory leaks
- **OMEGA6**: Stable core, isolated plugins

### 2. Performance
- **OMEGA5**: OpenGL overhead often worse than PyGame
- **OMEGA6**: Optimized C++ core, Python plugins

### 3. Development Speed
- **OMEGA5**: Weeks to add features
- **OMEGA6**: Hours to add plugins

### 4. Debugging
- **OMEGA5**: Complex multi-file issues
- **OMEGA6**: Isolated plugin debugging

## Feature Comparison

| Feature | OMEGA5 | OMEGA6 |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Spectrum Analyzer | Custom | Friture + Enhanced |
| LUFS Meters | ✓ | ✓ (Plugin) |
| True Peak | ✓ | ✓ (Plugin) |
