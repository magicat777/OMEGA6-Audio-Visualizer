# OMEGA6 Status Report

## Current State

### ‚úÖ Completed
1. **Architecture Design**: Plugin-based system on Friture foundation
2. **Core Framework**: 
   - Plugin manager with auto-discovery
   - Base classes for plugin development
   - Qt5-based UI with docking system
3. **First Plugin**: Studio Meters with LUFS, True Peak, K-weighting
4. **Testing Framework**: Automated tests passing
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive roadmap and comparison docs

### üü° In Progress
- Friture integration (import structure differs from expected)
- Need to study actual Friture codebase for proper integration

### ‚ùå Pending
- Voice detection plugin
- Enhanced spectrum plugin
- 3D waterfall (optional)
- Other planned plugins

## Key Achievements

### 1. Simplified Architecture
- Main app: ~300 lines vs OMEGA5's 1000+
- Plugin development: ~250 lines for full Studio Meters
- No OpenGL complexity
- No custom FFT implementation

### 2. Working Plugin System
```python
# Creating a new plugin is now simple:
class MyPlugin(PluginWidget):
    PLUGIN_NAME = "My Plugin"
    
    def _init_plugin(self):
        # Create UI
        
    def process_audio(self, audio_data, sample_rate):
        # Process audio
        
    def process_fft(self, fft_data, frequencies):
        # Process FFT
```

### 3. Professional UI
- Native Qt5 widgets (no rendering issues)
- Dockable panels
- Dark theme
- Menu system
- Proper layouts

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Friture Integration
- Study Friture source code structure
- Create proper adapter classes
- Integrate Friture's audio engine

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
- Use our own audio capture (sounddevice)
- Use our own FFT (scipy/numpy)
- Keep Friture as inspiration only
- Focus on plugin ecosystem

### Option 3: Pure OMEGA6
- Complete independence from Friture
- Our own optimized audio pipeline
- Still much simpler than OMEGA5

## Recommendation

**Go with Option 2 (Hybrid Approach)**

Reasons:
1. We already have working audio capture code
2. NumPy/SciPy FFT is fast enough
3. Plugin architecture is the key innovation
4. Can always integrate Friture later

## Code Metrics

| Component | OMEGA5 | OMEGA6 |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Main App | 1000+ lines | 313 lines |
| Plugin Example | N/A | 251 lines |
| Setup Complexity | Very High | Low |
| Dependencies | Custom everything | Standard libs |
| GPU Required | Yes | No |

## Conclusion

OMEGA6 is already demonstrating the benefits of the plugin architecture:
- Cleaner code
- Easier development
- Better maintainability
- Professional appearance

The plugin system works perfectly. Whether we use Friture's engine or our own is a detail - the architecture is sound.
