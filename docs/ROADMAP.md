# OMEGA6 Development Roadmap

## Overview
OMEGA6 represents a paradigm shift from custom engine development to a plugin-based architecture built on proven foundations (Friture).

## Architecture Benefits

### Why Friture?
1. **Proven Core**: Stable real-time audio processing
2. **Cross-platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux
3. **Optimized FFT**: Years of performance tuning
4. **Active Development**: Regular updates and bug fixes

### Plugin Architecture
1. **Modularity**: Enable/disable features as needed
2. **Isolation**: Plugin crashes don't affect core
3. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new visualizations
4. **Maintainability**: Focus on features, not engine

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (Current)
- [x] Create project structure
- [x] Design plugin framework
- [x] Implement plugin manager
- [x] Create base plugin classes
- [x] Build Studio Meters plugin
- [ ] Test Friture integration
- [ ] Create development documentation

### Phase 2: Core Plugins
- [ ] **Voice Detection Plugin**
  - Port existing voice detection code
  - Create overlay visualization
  - Add confidence meters
  
- [ ] **Enhanced Spectrum Plugin**
  - Multi-resolution FFT display
  - Configurable frequency ranges
  - Peak hold and averaging
  
- [ ] **Bass Zoom Plugin**
  - Detailed low-frequency visualization
  - 20-250Hz focus with high resolution
  - Harmonic markers

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] **3D Waterfall Plugin** (Optional)
  - OpenGL-based if performance allows
  - Fallback to 2D if needed
  - Time-frequency-amplitude visualization
  
- [ ] **Chromagram Plugin**
  - Music theory analysis
  - Key detection
  - Chord recognition
  
- [ ] **Harmonic Analysis Plugin**
  - Instrument identification
  - THD measurement
  - Formant tracking

### Phase 4: Integration & Polish
- [ ] **Layout Manager**
  - Save/load workspace layouts
  - Preset configurations
  - Multi-monitor support
  
- [ ] **Recording & Export**
  - Audio recording
  - Screenshot/video capture
  - Data export (CSV, JSON)
  
- [ ] **Theme System**
  - Dark/light themes
  - Custom color schemes
  - Plugin styling

## Migration Strategy

### From OMEGA5 to OMEGA6
1. **Identify Essential Features**: What users actually use
2. **Port Incrementally**: One plugin at a time
3. **Improve While Porting**: Fix known issues
4. **Test Continuously**: Ensure stability

### Features to Port
- [x] LUFS metering
- [x] True Peak detection
- [x] K-weighting
- [ ] Voice detection
- [ ] Multi-resolution spectrum
- [ ] Bass detail panel
- [ ] Phase correlation
- [ ] Genre detection

### Features to Reconsider
- Complex 3D visualizations (if performance impact)
- Rarely used analysis modes
- Over-engineered components

## Performance Goals

### Target Metrics
- **FPS**: Stable 60 FPS with all plugins
- **Latency**: <20ms audio-to-visual
- **CPU Usage**: <30% on modern systems
- **Memory**: <500MB with all plugins

### Optimization Strategy
1. **Profile First**: Measure before optimizing
2. **GPU Optional**: Not required for core features
3. **Batch Updates**: Reduce redundant calculations
4. **Smart Scheduling**: Update panels at different rates

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: For each plugin
2. **Integration Tests**: Plugin interactions
3. **Performance Tests**: FPS and latency
4. **User Testing**: Real-world usage

### Documentation
1. **User Guide**: How to use OMEGA6
2. **Plugin Development**: How to create plugins
3. **API Reference**: Plugin interfaces
4. **Troubleshooting**: Common issues

## Success Metrics

### Technical
- Stable 60 FPS operation
- No memory leaks
- Clean plugin isolation
- Easy plugin development

### User Experience
- Intuitive interface
- Responsive controls
- Professional appearance
- Reliable operation

## Next Steps

1. **Test Friture Integration**: Verify it meets our needs
2. **Port Voice Detection**: First custom plugin
3. **Create Demo Video**: Show OMEGA6 capabilities
4. **Get User Feedback**: What features matter most

## Conclusion

OMEGA6 represents learned lessons from OMEGA1-5:
- Don't reinvent the wheel
- Build on proven foundations
- Focus on unique value
- Prioritize stability

By leveraging Friture's solid core and adding our specialized plugins, we can deliver a professional tool without the complexity and issues of a fully custom engine.
